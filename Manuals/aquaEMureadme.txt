Thanks for downloading the worlds first Mattel Aquarius Emulator.

I started this emulator as a fun project to keep my C++ Skills up to date.

Make sure that Aquarius.rom is in the same directory as AqEmu.exe
It will only work on Windows 95/98/NT and Windows 2000,
Sorry, but it does not work under DOS, Linux, Beos or Windows 3.x

NOTES.
1. The keyboard emulation faithfully emulates the properties of the old
Aquarius. This includes having some characters in strange places and 
the quirky behaviour where sometimes a keypress is not recognized immediately.

Aquarius veterans will remember having to type slowly!!!!
