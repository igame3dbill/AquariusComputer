Does it work under NTSC?<br>==<br>Here's how
Emucompboy dumps Aquarius game cartridges:<br><br>Set up
your Aquarius so you can record sounds back and forth
from your PC. (I have mine hooked up to my VCR, and
have the VCR's sound output hooked up to my computer's
sound card input).<br><br>In the Quicktype directory
you'll find a program called ROMSND.TXT. Load that into
the emulator. Save it right back out as a CAQ file.
Use the CAQ2WAV program to convert it into a WAV
file. Load that into your real Aquarius.<br><br>Then,
with the real Aquarius still on, plug in the
cartridge. You need to be pretty sure-handed about this and
plug it in straight. I manage to do this about 75% of
the time with the Aquarius, and about 50% of the time
with the NEC Trek. The risk is that you'll wreck your
computer or your cartridge or both.<br><br>Set up your PC
to record sounds from your real Aquarius -- and
start recording. On the real Aquarius, run the ROMSND
program. It will make beeping noises for about 20 minutes.
When the beeping noises stops (and the ROMSND program
puts up a message about starting a checksum), then you
can stop recording on your PC. Save out the WAV file.
It's about 100 Megabytes, if you recorded it at 44,100
samples per second.<br><br>Run the enormous WAV file
through the SQUWAV program. The output file will be the
same size as the input, but should ZIP down to about 1
Megabyte.<br><br>Copy down the checksum numbers exactly as they appear
from the Aquarius.<br><br>E-Mail me the zipped _SQ.WAV
file and the checksum numbers. With luck, I can turn
them into a ROM image file. I have a program for doing
this, but it requires changing 32 parameters each time
it is run. Do you have Microsoft Visual C++
6.0?<br><br>==<br>The Extended BASIC cartridge should not require
inserting the cartridge while the computer is on, so
there'd be no risk to the cartridge or computer. The
ROMSND program is set to make sounds out of $C000-$FFFF,
which is where games reside. The Extended BASIC
cartridge might occupy the same address, or it might do the
"CP/M swap" and reside at $0000-$1FFF, or it might be
an "extension ROM" and reside at $2000-$2FFF. Some
experimentation, with the WINDOW program might be in order.
